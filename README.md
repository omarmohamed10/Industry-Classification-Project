# Industry-Classification-Project

## Problem Formulation: 

You can think of the job industry as the category or general field in which you work. 
On a job application, industry refers to a broad category under which a number of job titles can fall. 
For example, sales is an industry; job titles under this category can include sales associate, sales manager, 
manufacturing sales rep, pharmaceutical sales and so on.

You are required to build a model using any Machine Learning classifier algorithm to classify job titles by the industry 
and provide us with insights on how your model works.
